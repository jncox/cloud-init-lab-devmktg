What We Are Doing

- Cloud-Init intro

- Deployment of a CentOS 7 based development environment bootstrapped with Cloud-Init

.. _requirements:

What We Aren't Doing
####################

This lab is not intended as a guide for end-to-end Prism Element or Prism Central **training**.  While the screenshots and copy/paste steps will allow you to create a working development VM, it is assumed that basic virtual infrastructure knowledge is already available.

You will almost certainly need to make modifications to the provided Cloud-Init demos before you can use them in production.

Requirements
############

To successfully complete this lab, you will need access to a Nutanix environment.  This can be any one of the following:

- Prism Element or Prism Central via your own cluster
- Prism Element or Prism Central via the Nutanix demo system (for the Nutanix partner community)
- Nutanix Community_ Edition

###############

Although many Nutanix Developer labs can be run in a presenter-led environment, this quick lab is aimed to be run at your own pace and in your own environment.  VM images required for the labs will be outlined during the course of the lab.
